# Obstacle Detection and Avoidance Robot 🤖🚗

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an autonomous
Obstacle Detection and Avoidance Robot that can navigate its environment
safely without human intervention.

The robot detects obstacles in real time using ultrasonic sensors and
dynamically changes its direction to avoid collisions. It also supports
manual control using Bluetooth communication.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect obstacles using ultrasonic sensors
- Avoid collisions autonomously
- Enable real-time decision making
- Provide manual control via Bluetooth
- Improve safety and efficiency in robotic navigation

## 🛠️ Technologies & Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- L293D Motor Driver
- DC Gear Motors & Robot Wheels
- Servo Motor
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- Li-ion Batteries
- Arduino IDE (Embedded C/C++)

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to obstacles.
If an obstacle is detected within a predefined threshold:
- The robot stops
- Moves backward dynamically
- Scans left and right using a servo-mounted sensor
- Chooses the safest direction and continues movement

Bluetooth control allows manual navigation when required.
